## Hello, I'm Ulrik! 
I'm a passionate and aspiring data analyst from Norway, currently working as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. I'm Welcome to my GitHub!



### ðŸ¥¥  Me in a nutshell
  
- I have a master's degree in special needs pedagogy in May 2022 with a grade A.
 
- During my work with my Master's thesis I started to love the nuances and possibilities of data, the vizualisations you create with it, and the impact that can come from it. Because of this I changed my trajectory towards working with data analysis in the second half of 2022 with a Google Data Analyst certification and subsequent with a full Data Analyst certification from DataCamp. 

- Currently employed as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. 

### âž• What I'm working on now
As an aspiring junior data analyst I am learning the fundamentals of data analysis. 
  1. Excel and R programming are commonly used in an academic capacity at the University where I work, so these are my preliminary focus. 
  
    1.1. I do this by working with both TidyTuesday vizualisations, as well as a broader analyst project. 

  2. I am working towards a Data Analyst certification from DataCamp, which currently involves R programming, but will also in a large degree involve SQL.
