## Hello there!
My name is Ulrik and I'm a passionate (aspiring) data analyst from Norway, currently working as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. Welcome to my GitHub!



### 🥥  Me in a (coco)nut shell
  
- I have a master's degree in special needs pedagogy from the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences of May 2022, where I was one of three who got an A in our course. 

- Currently employed as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. 
 
- During my work with my Master's thesis I started to love the nuances and possibilities of data, the vizualisations you create with it, and the impact that can come from it. 

- Because of this newfound passion I changed my trajectory towards working with data analysis in the second half of 2022 with a Google Data Analyst certification. Since completing this in November, I have started another class in SQL, and finished multiple three individual courses in R. Now I'm working primarily with Python programming. 

### ☀️ My personality  
- I am positive and outgoing person with loads of enthusiasm. 
- I'm a structured person with regards to my work and my life in general. 
- I like solving big and small problems alike (_especially those that require finicky work in Excel or R_) both alone and in cooperation with other people. 
 

### ➕ What I'm working on now
**Skills:** 
– Python: Automation.
– SQL: Joins. 

**Course:** I'm  taking the SQL Basics for Data Science course by UC Davis, and the Crash Course on Python by Google. 

**Practice** I solve Leetcode problems alongside my Python-course. 

**Portfolio:** _I'm working diligently to have some projects to showcase in the near future._
