## Hello there!
My name is Ulrik and I'm a passionate data analyst from Norway, currently working as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. Welcome to my GitHub!

### ü••  Me in a nutshell
  
- I have a master's degree in special needs pedagogy from the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences where I got an A. 

- I'm currently employed as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. 
 
- During my work with my Master's thesis I started to love the nuances and possibilities of data, the vizualisations you create with it, and the impact that can come from it. 

- Because of this newfound passion I changed my trajectory towards working with data analysis in the second half of 2022 with a Google Data Analyst certification. Since completing this in November I have started multiple other classes, working primarily with SQL and R.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è My personality  
- I am a positive and outgoing person with loads of enthusiasm. 

- I'm structured and systematic. 

- I like solving big and small problems alike (_especially those that require finicky work in Excel or R_) both alone and in cooperation with other people.
