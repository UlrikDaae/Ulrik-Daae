## Hello there!
My name is Ulrik and I'm a passionate data analyst from Norway, currently working as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. Welcome to my GitHub!

### 🥥  Me in a nutshell
  
- I have a master's degree in special needs pedagogy from the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences where I got an A. 

- I'm currently employed as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. 
 
- During my work with my Master's thesis I started to love the nuances and possibilities of data, the vizualisations you create with it, and the impact that can come from it. 

- Because of this newfound passion I changed my trajectory towards working with data analysis in the second half of 2022 with a Google Data Analyst certification. Since completing this in November, I have started another class in SQL, and finished multiple three individual courses in R. Now I'm working primarily with Python programming. 

### ☀️ My personality  
- I am a positive and outgoing person with loads of enthusiasm. 

- I'm a structured person with regards to my work and my life in general. 

- I like solving big and small problems alike (_especially those that require finicky work in Excel or R_) both alone and in cooperation with other people. 
 

### ➕ What I'm working on now
**Specific skills I'm working on:** 
- R: Improved data visualizations.

- SQL: Joins and subqueries. 

- Excel: VBA.

**Courses I'm taking:** I'm  taking the SQL Basics for Data Science course by UC Davis  and the Data Analysis with R Specialization.
