## Hello there!
My name is Ulrik and I'm a passionate (aspiring) data analyst from Norway, currently working as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. Welcome to my GitHub!



### ü••  Me in a (coco)nut shell
  
- I have a master's degree in special needs pedagogy from the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences of May 2022, where I was one of three who got an A in our course. 

- Currently employed as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. 
 
- During my work with my Master's thesis I started to love the nuances and possibilities of data, the vizualisations you create with it, and the impact that can come from it. 

- Because of this newfound passion I changed my trajectory towards working with data analysis in the second half of 2022 with a Google Data Analyst certification. Since completing this in November, I have started working towards DataCamps Data Analysis Professional certification as well as completing the SQL for Data Sciene course by UC Davis. 


### ‚òÄÔ∏è My personality  
- I am an outgoing person with loads of enthusiasm. 


### ‚ûï What I'm working on now
**Course:** I am working towards DataCamps Data Analyst Professional certification. Currently I am working through the R curriuclum, soon moving on to SQL. 

**Portfolio:** I am working with the R For Datascience's TidyTuesday datasets to get more practical data analysis experience, and to build a portfolio of analyses.

**Skills** Entry-level Tableau vizualisations.
