## Hello, I'm Ulrik! 
I'm a passionate and aspiring data analyst from Norway, currently working as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. I'm Welcome to my GitHub!



### 🥥  Me in a (coco)nut shell
  
- I have a master's degree in special needs pedagogy in May 2022 with a grade A.
 
- During my work with my Master's thesis I started to love the nuances and possibilities of data, the vizualisations you create with it, and the impact that can come from it. Because of this I changed my trajectory towards working with data analysis in the second half of 2022 with a Google Data Analyst certification and subsequent with a full Data Analyst certification from DataCamp. 

- Currently employed as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. 

### ➕ What I'm working on now
**Course:** I am working towards DataCamps Data Analyst Associate certification. Currently I am working through the R curriuclum, soon moving on to SQL. 

**Portfolio:** I am working with the R-TidyTuesday datasets to get more practical data analysis experience. 

**Skills and programs** Entry-level Tableau vizualisations.
