## Hello there!
My name is Ulrik and I'm a passionate data analyst from Norway, currently working as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. Welcome to my GitHub!

### üöÄ QUICK RECAP
- Portfolio: [Excel](https://github.com/UlrikDaae/Projects/tree/main/Excel), [SQL](https://github.com/UlrikDaae/Leetcode_Solutions/tree/main/SQL), [SQL Explanation videos.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1VJJHJPCkeOqn01ES3qwGQ)


### ü••  Me in a nutshell
  
- I have a master's degree in special needs pedagogy from the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences where I got an A. 

- I'm currently employed as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. 
 
- During my work with my Master's thesis I started to love the nuances and possibilities of data, the vizualisations you create with it, and the impact that can come from it. 

- Because of this newfound passion I changed my trajectory towards working with data analysis in the second half of 2022 with a Google Data Analyst certification. Since completing this in November, I have started another class in SQL, and finished multiple three individual courses in R. Now I'm working primarily with Python programming. 

### ‚òÄÔ∏è My personality  
- I am positive and outgoing person with loads of enthusiasm. 

- I'm a structured person with regards to my work and my life in general. 

- I like solving big and small problems alike (_especially those that require finicky work in Excel or R_) both alone and in cooperation with other people. 
 

### ‚ûï What I'm working on now
**Specific skills I'm working on:** 
- Python: Basic automation.

- SQL: Joins and subqueries. 

- Excel: Practice VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, INDEX and MATCH to efficiently find specific data. 

**Courses I'm taking:** I'm  taking the SQL Basics for Data Science course by UC Davis, and the Crash Course on Python by Google. 


### üóÇ My work
- **Excel:** I do have some [Excel-files](https://github.com/UlrikDaae/Projects/tree/main/Excel) in my projects section that I've created this December for fun. They're fictitious, but quite realistic datasets that I have analysed. _I currently have two projects I'm working on. One is a complete analysis of all fines for US financial institutions from 2000-22, and the other is an analysis of performance of Norwegian IPOs from 2020-22. **If you're interested in seeing some of this, check my Twittter or contact me through LinkedIn._

_I'm currently analysing all IPOs on the OSEBX from 2020-22. If you're interested in seeing this progress, please contact me on LinkedIn._
- **SQL** You can find my LeetCode solutions with written explanations [here](https://github.com/UlrikDaae/Leetcode_Solutions/tree/main/SQL) and my [YouTube explanations here.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1VJJHJPCkeOqn01ES3qwGQ)

 _This is however, a continuous work in progress and I aim to be sharing some projects in the next few months._
