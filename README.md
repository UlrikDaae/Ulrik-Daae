## Hello, I'm Ulrik! 
I'm a passionate and aspiring data analyst from Norway, currently working as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. Welcome to my GitHub!



### ðŸ¥¥  Me in a nutshell
  
- I have a master's degree in special needs pedagogy in May 2022 with a grade A.
 
- During my work with my Master's thesis I started to love the nuances and possibilities of data, the vizualisations you create with it, and the impact that can come from it. Because of this I changed my trajectory towards working with data analysis in the second half of 2022, within iether academia as a PhD candidate, or in a junior analyst position. 

- Currently work as a research assistant at the University of Oslo.
