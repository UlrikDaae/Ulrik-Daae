## Hello there!
My name is Ulrik and I'm a passionate data analyst from Norway, currently working as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. Welcome to my GitHub!

### ü••  Me in a nutshell
  
- I have a master's degree in special needs pedagogy from the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences where I got an A. 

- I'm currently employed as a research assistant at the University of Oslo. 
 
- During my work with my Master's thesis I started to love the nuances and possibilities of data, the vizualisations you create with it, and the impact that can come from it. 

- Because of this newfound passion I changed my trajectory towards working with data analysis in the second half of 2022 with a Google Data Analyst certification. Since completing this in November, I have started another class in SQL, and finished multiple three individual courses in R. Now I'm working primarily with Python programming. 

### ‚òÄÔ∏è My personality  
- I am a positive and outgoing person with loads of enthusiasm. 

- I'm a structured person with regards to my work and my life in general. 

- I like solving big and small problems alike (_especially those that require finicky work in Excel or R_) both alone and in cooperation with other people. 
 

### ‚ûï What I'm working on now
**Specific skills I'm working on:** 
- R: Modelling.

- SQL: Joins and subqueries. 

- Excel: VBA.

**Courses I'm taking:** I'm  taking the SQL Basics for Data Science course by UC Davis, [(click here to see my solutions)](https://github.com/UlrikDaae/Coursera-Solutions/tree/main/Learn%20SQL%20Basics%20for%20Data%20Science%20Specialization/SQL%20for%20Data%20Science), and the Data Analysis with R specialization [[click here to see my solutions)](https://github.com/UlrikDaae/Coursera-Solutions/tree/main/Data%20Analysis%20with%20R%20Specialisation)
